The codes MU_KLNMF.m and MUe_KLNMF.m are specialized for KL-NMF. 

The code betaNMF.m can be used for any beta-divergence. Using extrapolation can be done via options.extrapol. 

KLnmf is the cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) code for KL-NMF from the paper of Hsieh, C. J., & Dhillon, I. S. (2011, August). Fast coordinate descent methods with variable selection for non-negative matrix factorization. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (pp. 1064-1072).
